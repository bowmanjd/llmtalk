Your role: you are an entertaining technical presenter, loved by software developers and IT professionals and computer science students. In that role you also consult with other presenters, reviewing and improving their presentations. In fact, you are my co-presenter and we are working on a presentation together.

Topic of presentation: open-weight large language models.

I have a myriad of subtopics I am trying to prioritize, synthesize, and organize:
- self-hosting small models
- ollama vs llama.cpp vs vLLM vs other options
- local model routing with LiteLLM
- navigating inference providers (openrouter.ai, deepinfra.com, together.ai, novita.ai, cerebras.ai, and so on)
- renting GPUs in the cloud (runpod, modal, vast, etc.), but I don't want to spend a lot of time on this
- hardware choices: CPU vs GPU, which GPU, what Mac users have available to them
- the importance of optimizing for your hardware (get the right llama.cpp, for instance)
- Quantization
  - like compression
	- trade-offs of performance, speed, RAM usage
	- GGUF as the hero of local inference.
- How to find models
	- huggingface.co
	- openrouter
	- the usefulness (and lies!) of leaderboards and benchmarks (use them to get clues, but don't rely on them)
	  - artificalanalysis.ai
		- https://www.vellum.ai/open-llm-leaderboard
		- https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/ (LM Arena)
		- https://kaitchup.substack.com/p/the-kaitchup-index
- The current and future potential of smaller models: look at artificalanalysis.ai and we see that today's small/medium models perform as well as last year's flagship models (like GPT 4.0)
- recommended models for various scenarios. For example (all of these are in the form of huggingface.co paths):
  - Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B (ridiculously small, and takes some finesse)
  - Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B (very small but useful, good for cpu-only)
  - Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 (very capable for its size, will work on many laptops with or without GPU)
  - google/gemma-3n-E4B-it as well as google/gemma-3n-E2B-it (a lot of performance in a resource-saving package)
  - nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 (larger if you have a little more RAM)
  - openai/gpt-oss-20b if you have larger GPU and RAM
  - Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct for coding (if you have the resources)
  - and so on. I do not plan on recommending Llama models, as I find they underperform in comparison to the above
- also should have at least one slide for embedding models, which make sense for local use:
  - Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
  - google/embeddinggemma-300m
  - mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1
- consider re-ranking models for local use, such as
  - BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3
  - Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B
- using smaller models is quite different than using flagship "frontier" models:
  - prompting is very important, and tailored to the model
  - evaluate and experiment
  - consider use cases appropriate for small models: summarization, titling, model routing, etc. Simple use cases that simply do not need the expense of the larger models

Audience: The audience is **technical** but has **varying levels of familiarity** with LLMs; from novices to seasoned practitioners. The audience is all ages, and mostly made up of software developers, IT personnel, technology enthusiasts, computer science and data science students. Let's "bias" towards the engineer who is familiar with using big models, but has not yet explored self-hosting and small models.

Objective: Audience members should leave thinking that "the world of language models is more diverse and more useful than I thought" and also, hopefully, "I have tools at my disposal to make use of this diverse world of language models"

Length: 30 minutes

I don't have a great title yet. Possible titles I have considered (notice the themes):
- "What are you inferring?" Viewing the language model landscape
- Beyond the Chatbot: the Wide World of Open-Weight LLMs
- DIY AI: Discovering and Running Open-Weight Language Models
- The "tossed salad" of language models
- It's not all big and expensive
- The language model poly-culture

Goals:
- open the audience's eyes to a vast and more diverse landscape than they were already aware (many may only think of ChatGPT, or possibly Claude or Gemini or Grok, and simply aren't aware of others out there)
- help audience members consider self-hosting small models
- help developers who are engineering AI-based applications to consider the vast array of models available from inference providers, yielding great performance and cost savings
- engage and entertain the audience interactively. This will include asking questions that elicit audience feedback. This can be structured survey's, but informal and low-tech, as I don't want the participants to need to log in or feel pressured to participate

Your tasks (think carefully, step-by-step, and provide the requested outputs for my review):
1. List out any constructive questions that will help prioritize, clarify and refine my goals
2. propose several good titles for the presentation in this format: "A short title: a longer subtitle that explains a little more" Humor and play-on-words are appropriate, but not always necessary
3. suggest additional topics/subtopics, references or resources I should also consider
4. When ready (after gathering information), suggest an overall structure and order of slide sections, with approximate slide count per section
5. within each section, outline each slide, with the key talking point per slide

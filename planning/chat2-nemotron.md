### **4. Proposed Structure & Slide Count**  
**Total Slides**: ~25 (30 minutes = ~1 slide per minute, with pauses for interaction).  

#### **Section 1: Introduction (4 slides)**  
1. **Title Slide**: "The LLM Jungle: Navigating the Open-Weight Wild"  
   - Hook: "Did you know there are *thousands* of open models outperforming GPT-4?"  
2. **Why This Matters**:  
   - "The world of LLMs is *not* just ChatGPT. Let’s explore the hidden gems."  
3. **Audience Poll**: "Raise your hand if you’ve used a model other than ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini."  
4. **Agenda**:  
   - "We’ll cover self-hosting, tools, optimization, and real-world use cases."  

#### **Section 2: The LLM Landscape (5 slides)**  
5. **Beyond the Big Names**:  
   - "ChatGPT, Claude, etc. are just the tip of the iceberg."  
6. **Open-Weight vs. Closed Models**:  
   - "Open models = freedom, flexibility, and cost savings."  
7. **Model Diversity**:  
   - "From 0.6B to 30B parameters – there’s a model for every need."  
8. **Leaderboards & Lies**:  
   - "Benchmarks are clues, not gospel. Use them wisely."  
9. **Interactive Question**: "Which model do you think is best for coding? (Poll: Qwen3-Coder vs. Llama3)"  

#### **Section 3: Self-Hosting & Tools (6 slides)**  
10. **Why Self-Host?**:  
    - "Control, privacy, and cost savings."  
11. **Tools Compared**:  
    - "Ollama (simple), llama.cpp (performance), vLLM (scalability)."  
12. **Hardware Choices**:  
    - "CPU vs. GPU: What’s right for you? (Mac users, rejoice!)"  
13. **Quantization & GGUF**:  
    - "Compression = speed + lower RAM. GGUF is the hero."  
14. **Model Routing with LiteLLM**:  
    - "Route requests to the right model for your use case."
